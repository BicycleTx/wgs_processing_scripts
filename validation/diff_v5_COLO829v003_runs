# Checks performed:
#  - Visually compare metadata (run will be different, rest should be identical).
#  - Pipeline version doesn't matter but file should exist.
#  - Visually inspect the flagstats to see if they roughly match.
#  - Number of lines in germline vcf should be max 10 difference.
#  - No difference in snp genotype number of lines.
#  - No difference in number of files in any of the tertiary analyses.
