## Data Analysis Procedures

**Patient report procedure**

When Hartwig Medical Foundation sends out a "patient report" for a tumor biopsy analysis, the final list of somatic variants is "consensus filtered". This means that only genomic variants are taken into account that have enough support from the various analysis tools (in another words: the tools have to reach consensus).
