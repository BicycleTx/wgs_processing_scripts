**Scope of the CPCT-02 protocol**
The primary objective of this study is to analyze the individual cancer genome in cancer patients to develop future predictors for response to systemic treatment in individual patients with cancer.

Secondary objectives of this study are:
- To determine the amount of biopsy samples with sufficient DNA for analysis
- To determine the amount of biopsy samples with an adequate mutational profile
- To collect and anonymously interpret all mutational profiles obtained using this protocol
- To determine changes in the mutational profile under the influence of systemic treatment
- To explore and analyze the individual microRNA, (phospho)proteomic profiles and organoid cultures in patients with cancer to develop future predictors for response to systemic treatment
- To explore the correlation between mutational profiles in solid tumor biopsies and liquid biopsies (circulating tumor DNA)
